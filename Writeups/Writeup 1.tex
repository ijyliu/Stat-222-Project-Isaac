    problem statement and question

    Company ratings and creditworthiness are important information for investors - not just institutional investors and financially sophisticated bondholders, but also stockholders, who may be wiped out completely in the event of bankruptcy.

    Are ratings based on hard numbers, or do company outlooks and sentiment also matter? Are they predictable?

    note credit rating data access is limited and our model can be used to interpolate

    In this project, we seek to explore whether incorporating the text of earnings calls improves predictions of corporate credit ratings.

    high level data description

    Though much literature has focused on financial statements and reports and credit ratings (CITATIONS HERE), our paper takes a relatively underexplored approach, instead incorporating earnings call transcripts. We believe calls offer a richer picture of a firm's financial prospects because they include two-way conversation between company management and financial analysts in form of a Q&A section. This section incorporates the broader beliefs and concerns of the financial community into our predictions. Prior work has recognized the 'wisdom of the crowd' in making predictions, and our approach fully accounts for it, going beyond the proclamations of a company's management.

    Calls also require less parsing - no looking for specific section of financial statement reports.

    \section*{Data and Exploratory Data Analysis}

    We combine a wide variety of data sources to support our predictions of credit ratings. Our scope of interest publicly traded companies from 2010-2016 (a limitation due to the availability of credit rating data). All data not from APIs was received as CSV or Excel files, which we converted to parquet files for efficient intermediate data storage throughout the project.

    Data is at the level of

    In all, we have \numQuarters \space quarters for \numCompanies \space unique companies.

    \subsection*{Credit Ratings}

    We make use of long-term credit rating issuances from S and P Rating Services, provided from a combination of two credit rating datasets from Kaggle \citep{gewerc_corporate_2020,makwana_corporate_2022}.

    Each issuance be a change in rating (upgrade, downgrade) or reaffirmation - they occur at ad-hoc intervals.

    Figure \ref{fig:credit-ratings} shows the distribution of rating grades used in our final dataset. Finer grades (+, -) are sometimes assigned by agencies, but these grades were removed for this project. Ratings of BBB and above are considered investment grade - these bonds carry empirical one-year default rates of ~0 to 1\%. Ratings below that are classified as junk, with default rates from 1 to 30, 40, or even 50\% for some years \citep{s_and_p_global_ratings_s_2024}. Most company-quarters have ratings around the BBB threshold, with very few cases on the extreme ends of the spectrum.

    \subsection*{Earnings Calls}

    API source

    Quarterly conference call transcripts that contains speaker remarks and Q and A session from 2010 - 2016.

    Remove all calls that happened more than 250 days prior and after the fixed quarter date

    The overall average call length stands at \avgCallLength words.

	\end{figure}

    \subsection*{Financial Statements}

    API source

    Items from balance sheet, cash flow statement, income statement, and company market capitalization
    
    124 variables in total. Examples: revenue, total liabilities, net income, EBITDA
    
    Limit to items reported in USD
    
    Winsorizing: Check for items mis-multiplied by 1,000 in parsing - if last digits are “000.00” and item is above or below 2.5\% and 97.5\% quantile, divide by 1,000

    Tests to ensure the value in income statement and balance sheet are consistent with each other.
