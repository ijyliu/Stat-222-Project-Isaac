	abstract = {Accurate credit ratings are an essential ingredient in the decision-making process for investors, rating agencies, bond portfolio managers, bankers, and policy makers, as well as an important input for risk management and regulation. Credit ratings are traditionally generated from models that use financial statement data and market data, which are tabular (numeric and categorical). Using machine learning methods, we construct a network of firms using U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings (denoted CorpNet) to enhance the traditional tabular data set with a corporate graph. We show that this generates accurate rating predictions with comparable and better performance to tabular models. We ensemble graph convolutional networks with highly-performant ensembled machine learning models using AutoGluon. This paper demonstrates both transductive and inductive methodologies to extend credit scoring models based on tabular data, which have been used by the ratings industry for decades, to the class of machine learning models on networks. The methodology is extensible to other financial machine learning models that may be enhanced using a corporate graph.

	abstract = {Specialized agencies issue corporate credit ratings to evaluate the creditworthiness of a company, serving as a crucial financial indicator for potential investors. These ratings offer a tangible understanding of the risks associated with the credit investment returns of a company. Every company aims to achieve a favorable credit rating, as it enables them to attract more investments and reduce their cost of capital. Credit rating agencies typically employ unique rating scales that are broadly categorized into investment-grade or non-investment-grade (junk) classes. Given the extensive assessment conducted by credit rating agencies, it becomes a challenge for companies to formulate a straightforward and all-encompassing set of rules which may help to understand and improve their credit rating. This paper employs explainable AI, specifically decision trees, using historical data to establish an empirical rule on financial ratios. The rule obtained using the proposed approach can be effectively utilized to understand as well as plan and attain an investment-grade rating. Additionally, the study investigates the temporal aspect by identifying the optimal time window for training data. As the availability of structured data for temporal analysis is currently limited, this study addresses this challenge by creating a large and high-quality curated dataset. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for conducting comprehensive temporal analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that the empirical rule derived from historical data, yields a high precision value, and therefore highlights the effectiveness of our proposed approach as a valuable guideline and a feasible decision support system.},

	abstract = {We develop a novel technique to extract credit-relevant information from the text of quarterly earnings calls. This information is not spanned by fundamental or market variables and forecasts future credit spread changes. One reason for such forecastability is that our text-based measure predicts future credit spread risk and firm profitability. More firm- and call-level complexity increase the forecasting power of our measure for spread changes. Out-of-sample portfolio tests show the information in our measure is valuable for investors. Both results suggest that investors do not fully internalize the credit-relevant information contained in earnings calls.},

In out-of-sample tests, we find that our measure improves the ability to predict credit events (bankruptcies, interest spreads, and credit rating downgrades), relative to credit risk measures developed by prior research (e.g., z-score). We also find our measure based on conference calls explains within-firm variation in future credit events; however, we find little evidence that the measures of credit risk developed by prior research explain within-firm variation in credit risk. Our measure has utility for both academics and practitioners, as the majority of firms do not have readily available measures of credit risk, such as actively-traded CDS or credit ratings. Our study also adds to the growing body of research using machine-learning methods to gather information from conference calls and MD\&A to explain key outcomes.},

In particular, firms close to a credit rating change do not selectively release good news or withhold bad news on their earnings information. Nor do the firms likely issue an optimistically biased forecast or a more precise forecast for good news than for bad news. Overall, there is no evidence suggesting that credit ratings are manipulated via management earnings forecasts.},

Both also predict the direction and magnitude of credit rating changes. Consistent with the linkage between the short sale and options markets, in models with both explanatory variables, the short fee remains significant in all specifications, while IVS loses explanatory power.},

We introduce FinBERT, a language model based on BERT, to tackle NLP tasks in the financial domain. Our results show improvement in every measured metric on current state-of-the-art results for two financial sentiment analysis datasets.
